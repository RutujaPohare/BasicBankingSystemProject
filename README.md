# BasicBankingSystemProject
I have created a basic banking system where i am dealing with the transactions that the customer has done.
here in the customer page we can see the list of customers available.  
I have added two transactional functionalities on this page that is to send money and view  transactions history
when customer clicks on send money then a new window will open which will ask for the customer name and the amount to be deposited to that customer 
after sending the monew that will reflect back in the table 
and in transackition history whatever transacktion are done those will be reflected.
